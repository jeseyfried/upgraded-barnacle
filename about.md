## What is Xanthan?
Xanthan is a simple static website template that facilitates making a website that is hosted for free, always accessible, and easy to update via GitHub Pages. 

It provides a number of features for digital storytelling with a Story Map-like interface. 

It's med-tech (not low or hi), which means that changes are a bit more technical than just editing a web form. But they don't require any programming skills.
