### Paleography is the study of handwritten scripts of the past
The documents on this page are samples of the paleography of the late fourteenth-century Crown of Aragon.

Documents like these can be found by searching in [PARES](https://pares.mcu.es/ParesBusquedas20/catalogo/search), a database of digitized images of archival documents maintained by the government of Spain...
