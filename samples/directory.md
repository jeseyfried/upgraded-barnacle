This page demonstrates a standard "card" directory to access site pages. 

The content of the cards is created through a Google Sheet. The URL is specified in the page's YAML header. In this case, it's 
[here]('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pP8KhM3E5rmA3ce2Q3oKNFmqJHnEuLT15Nkp_NI61u8/edit?usp=sharing#gid=0')

The style of cards is easily configurable through CSS properties (changing colors, fonts, sizing, etc)
