Niccolò Machiavelli, (1469-1527) is well known for his political writings---as well as his motives for political dominance and acquisition of power---but less appreciated are his impact on the writing of history. Machiavelli is known to have an enormous influence on many writers following his time.

Mark Phillips describes Machiavelli as, “a mediating figure in Florentine historiography, a native Florentine and republican, he was also a secretary, commissioned historian, and man of letters” (Phillips, 95). Some of Machiavelli’s greatest works titled _The Prince_ (1532) and _Discourses on Livy_ (1531), which were published after his death, intel most of his deep thoughts and opinions on the way we must view history. He shaped and developed a new outlook of being a leader, creating a state, establishing dominance through power, and how to stay in power.


Three of his main topics discussed are the implications of **learning from history, human nature, and fortune**. In short, Machiavelli tells us that we must learn from history in order to create and establish a better future. Human nature is one of the many characteristics we share, and we must see how it can be used to create a better state. And fortune: showing that the future is in your hands and that you can shape whether you succeed or fail. Each one builds from the last and establishes his lasting impact through history and politics.
