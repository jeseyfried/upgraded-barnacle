This is a foliated capital from the St. Denis Abbey. Located on the outskirts of Paris, the Abbey received the official designation of cathedral in 1966. The current structure includes many repairs after a period of pillage in the era of the French Revolution. This capital, probably dislodged during that time of disrepair and destruction, now resides in the <a href="https://www.musee-moyenage.fr/collection/oeuvre/chapiteau-acanthe-et-tete.html">Musée Cluny</a> in Paris.

This capital demonstrates the historical significance of the Abbey, rebuilt in the twelfth century under the leadership of Abbot Suger. In this stage of the Abbey's history, the architectural design featured Gothic styles and elements. The structure is the oldest example of the incorporation of all elements of Gothic architecture such as high narrow arches, rose windows, and foliated capitals.
